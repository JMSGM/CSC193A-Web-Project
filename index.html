    <h2>One of my favorite moves: The Goodfellas</h2>
<p><em>Goodfellas</em> is a movie about an <strong>Irishman </strong> who meets and becomes affiliated with a <strong>mafia family</strong>.</p>

<p>The Irishman eventually forms a strong bond with two other people affiliated with the mob, and this relationship is developed throughout the story in the best way. We watch them rise together, enjoying the power and money, but we also see how loyalty can quickly turn into fear and violence.</p>

<p>However, toward the end of the movie, paranoia and betrayal begin to tear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas">everything apart</a>. The fast pacing and growing tension make the downfall feel unavoidable, and the true cost of this life becomes painfully clear. Overall, itâ€™s a gripping, stylish film that shows both the thrill and the consequences of the gangster world.</p>
